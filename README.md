## About:
This is a game I created back in 2020. It's a Top/Down 2D Adventure game. I more use it as a example of what I've done in the past.
It's still a work in progress, you check out the [releases](https://github.com/K-209/Midnight-Cavern-Unity/releases) to play around with the Demo version.
For in right now. It is very limited due to the map size but I will work on the mapping more.

## Simple Controls: 
- Basic WASD controls or Arrow keys for movement.
- ESC for Pause menu
